The dataset includes 1035 images.
Cone-detection-revv are annotated in COCO Segmentation format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x480 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 9 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Randomly crop between 0 and 30 percent of the image
* Random brigthness adjustment of between 0 and +25 percent
